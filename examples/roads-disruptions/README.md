# roads-disruptions

This is a sample application to show the use of ***μ/log*** to log events
and instrument an application.

The application poll the [Transport For London (TFL)
API](https://api-portal.tfl.gov.uk/docs) for road disruptions.  It
tracks in realtime the disruptions to the main road corridors around
London (UK).  A REST api allow the user to list all active disruptions
around London.

***This project is intended for demonstration purpose only!***

## Testing

0. Prepare the network and create an alias with
``` shell
# on linux
sudo ip addr add 192.168.200.200/32 dev wlan0

# on Mac OSX
sudo ifconfig en0 alias 192.168.200.200/32 up

# to remove alias
# sudo ifconfig en0 -alias 192.168.200.200/32
```

Alternatively, edit the `docker-compose.yaml` and add your local ip (non 127.0.0.1).
This is necessary for the producer to connect to the broker.

1. Start Kafka and ElasticSearch in background
``` shell
docker-compose rm -f && docker-compose up
```
2. Wait until all services are properly started and logs are settled.
3. Run the disruption service
``` shell
lein do clean, run
```
4. Open: http://localhost:9000/ for Kibana, click on **Management ->
   Index Patterns -> Create Index pattern**, then add the index
   pattern `mulog-*`, click **Next**, Choose `@timestamp` as time
   field, then click on **Create index pattern**.
5. Finally, Click on **Discover** and see the events as they arrive.
6. The same events should be printed in the console and in Kafka topic called **mulog**.
7. You can query the `roads-disruptions` on http://localhost:8000/ as follow:
``` shell
# to check the API status
curl -si http://localhost:8000/healthcheck

# to retrieve the current list of disruptions around London
curl -si http://localhost:8000/disruptions

# to log a few events on purpose
curl -si http://localhost:8000/{verbose,debug,info,warning,error,fatal}
```
Every interaction is logged in ***μ/log***.

The logs will be sent to the following destinations:

  - Console standard output (verbose and above)
  - Filesystem: `/tmp/mulog/events.log` (debug and above)
  - Kafka topic: `mulog` (info and above)
  - ElasticSearch index `mulog-YYYY.MM.DD` (info and above)

To see the events sent to Kafka run:

``` shell
docker exec -ti roads-disruptions_broker_1 /usr/bin/kafka-console-consumer --bootstrap-server localhost:9093 --topic mulog
```

Here a sample of the events that will be sent:
